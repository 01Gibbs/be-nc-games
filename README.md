## What is the Project?

This is a RESTful API backend based on CRUD operations utilising the Node Environment, Express and PostgreSQL

It was initially a module of the Northcoder's Coding Bootcamp. Post completion, I revisited and completed the project.

## Instructions

1 - To start you will need to `git clone` repository locally.

2 - Upon opening the project, you will need to run `npm install` to install all dependencies

3 - `pg_databases` will need to be set within created `.env.test` and `.env.development` files and placed on the `.gitignore`

4 - For the purposes of this example, we will be exposing the database names to input into your local `.env` files. Please note that in working environments this is dangerous and highly not recommended.

5 - Set your `env.` files to `.env.test` and `.env.development` respectively.
